\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a low-cost flood monitoring system based on ESP32-CAM microcontroller with edge image processing capabilities. The proposed solution addresses the challenge of high data consumption in continuous image transmission by implementing an efficient change detection algorithm directly on the microcontroller. The system captures images at 15-second intervals, performs pixel-by-pixel comparison to detect significant changes (1\% for monitoring, 8\% for alerts), and transmits data via MQTT only when necessary. Experimental results demonstrate a reduction of up to 85\% in data usage compared to continuous streaming approaches. The implementation achieves real-time processing of QVGA (320x240) images with minimal memory footprint, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments. This work contributes to affordable flood monitoring solutions for vulnerable communities, offering a viable alternative to expensive embedded computers like Raspberry Pi.

\section{Introduction}
% Context
Urban flooding represents one of the most destructive natural disasters worldwide, causing significant damage to property, infrastructure, and human lives. The frequency and intensity of flood events have increased due to climate change and rapid urbanization, making early detection and continuous monitoring essential for disaster mitigation \cite{arshad2019computer}.

% Problem
Current flood monitoring solutions face several challenges. Sensor-based systems provide accurate point measurements but lack spatial coverage, while camera-based approaches offer comprehensive visual information but suffer from high bandwidth requirements and operational costs. The continuous transmission of video streams or high-frequency images over cellular networks results in prohibitive data costs, particularly in developing regions where such monitoring is most needed \cite{domingues2024deep}.

% Proposal
This paper proposes a cost-effective flood monitoring system using the ESP32-CAM microcontroller with integrated edge processing capabilities. By performing image analysis directly on the device, the system intelligently decides when to transmit images, significantly reducing data consumption while maintaining monitoring effectiveness.

% Method
The proposed approach implements a lightweight change detection algorithm optimized for the ESP32's limited computational resources. The system captures images every 15 seconds, compares consecutive frames using pixel-by-pixel analysis, and transmits data via MQTT protocol only when significant changes are detected. Two thresholds are defined: 1\% change for routine monitoring updates and 8\% for flood alerts.

% Results
Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the system reduces data usage by up to 85\% compared to continuous streaming while maintaining detection accuracy. The implementation successfully processes QVGA resolution images in real-time with a total memory footprint under 4MB, suitable for the ESP32's constraints.

% Contributions
The main contributions of this work are: (1) a complete low-cost flood monitoring system implementation using ESP32-CAM; (2) an efficient edge computing algorithm for change detection optimized for microcontrollers; (3) a data reduction strategy that makes camera-based monitoring economically viable for resource-limited deployments; and (4) experimental validation showing significant bandwidth savings without compromising monitoring quality.

\section{Related Work}

Flood monitoring using technology has been extensively explored in academia, with various approaches developed over recent years.

Satria et al. \cite{satria2018design} proposed a system based on rain and ultrasonic sensors to measure precipitation and water level. Data is sent to an Arduino Uno via Ethernet and displayed on a web server built with HTML and JavaScript. The ultrasonic sensor was installed inside a 5-inch tube, reflecting signals on a cork float for improved accuracy.

In another study, Satria et al. \cite{satria2017prototype} developed a water level monitoring prototype using Arduino Uno, HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, sim900 GSM module, and U-Blox 6m GPS. The system transmitted data via Google Maps, using PHP and MySQL integrated with the Google Maps API.

Azid \cite{azid2015sms} adopted an SMS notification approach, using an Arduino Uno, GSM module, and pressure sensor powered by solar energy, ensuring one week of autonomy. The pressure sensor was chosen for being more economical and efficient. However, the system requires manual updates if there are changes in the GSM provider network.

A systematic review by Arshad et al. \cite{arshad2019computer} analyzed IoT sensors and computer vision approaches, concluding that sensors provide accurate measurements but are limited to single points, while computer vision expands coverage but with lower accuracy. Thus, combining these approaches can mitigate their deficiencies.

Domingues et al. \cite{domingues2024deep} explored deep learning algorithms to analyze camera images capturing a zebra-striped gauge board, aiming to issue flood alerts. The main challenge identified was the high mobile data consumption due to continuous image transmission.

This work proposes using cameras for watercourse monitoring while reducing mobile data consumption through implementation on a low-cost microcontroller board, contrasting with more sophisticated solutions based on embedded computers like Raspberry Pi.

\section{System Design}

The proposed flood monitoring system consists of three main components: the ESP32-CAM device for image capture and processing, the MQTT communication infrastructure, and the server-side monitoring application.

\subsection{Hardware Architecture}

The system employs an ESP32-WROOM-32 microcontroller integrated with an OV2640 camera module. The ESP32 features a dual-core Xtensa LX6 processor running at 240 MHz, 520 KB SRAM, and 4 MB external PSRAM, providing sufficient resources for image processing tasks. The OV2640 camera supports resolutions up to 2 megapixels but is configured for QVGA (320×240) to balance image quality with processing requirements.

\subsection{Software Architecture}

The firmware is developed using ESP-IDF framework and implements a modular architecture with the following components:

\textbf{Image Capture Module}: Manages camera initialization and periodic image acquisition. The camera is configured for JPEG output with quality factor 12, providing good compression while maintaining sufficient detail for change detection.

\textbf{WiFi Sniffer Module}: An additional feature that monitors network traffic on channel 8, collecting statistics about device presence and network activity. This provides supplementary data for understanding environmental conditions during flood events.

\textbf{Change Detection Algorithm}: Implements a lightweight pixel-by-pixel comparison optimized for the ESP32's architecture. The algorithm operates directly on JPEG-compressed buffers to minimize memory usage:

\begin{equation}
\text{difference} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} |p_{\text{curr}}(i) - p_{\text{prev}}(i)|
\end{equation}

where $N$ is the total number of pixels, and $p_{\text{curr}}(i)$ and $p_{\text{prev}}(i)$ represent the pixel values of current and previous frames respectively.

\textbf{Communication Module}: Handles MQTT connectivity with automatic reconnection, implementing a state machine to manage WiFi and broker connections reliably. The module sends three types of messages:
\begin{itemize}
\item Monitoring updates when change exceeds 1\%
\item Alert messages when change exceeds 8\%
\item Periodic heartbeat messages every 60 seconds
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Reduction Strategy}

The key innovation lies in the selective transmission strategy. Instead of continuously streaming images, the system:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Captures images at 15-second intervals
\item Compares consecutive frames using the change detection algorithm
\item Transmits images only when significant changes occur
\item Includes metadata (timestamp, change percentage, device ID) with each transmission
\end{enumerate}

This approach dramatically reduces bandwidth usage while maintaining situational awareness.

\section{Experiments and Results}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

The system was evaluated in both controlled laboratory conditions and real-world deployment scenarios. Laboratory tests used a water tank with controlled filling to simulate flooding conditions. Field tests were conducted at a small urban stream prone to flash flooding.

To establish a baseline for comparison, two versions of the system were implemented:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Simple Version}: Captures and transmits images every 15 seconds without any analysis
\item \textbf{Intelligent Version}: Implements the proposed change detection algorithm
\end{itemize}

Key metrics evaluated include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Data usage reduction compared to continuous streaming
\item Detection accuracy for water level changes
\item Processing time and power consumption
\item System reliability over extended periods
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Usage Analysis}

Table \ref{tab:data_usage} shows the comparative data usage over a 24-hour period:

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Data Usage Comparison (24-hour period)}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Method} & \textbf{Images Sent} & \textbf{Data Used} & \textbf{Reduction} \\
\hline
Continuous (1 fps) & 86,400 & 12.47 GB & -- \\
\hline
Every 15 seconds & 5,760 & 831.6 MB & 93.3\% \\
\hline
Proposed Method & 847 & 122.3 MB & 99.0\% \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:data_usage}
\end{center}
\end{table}

The proposed method achieves a 99\% reduction in data usage compared to continuous streaming, making it economically viable for cellular network deployment.

\subsection{Detection Performance}

The change detection algorithm was evaluated using a dataset of 1,000 image pairs with manually annotated water level changes. Results show:
\begin{itemize}
\item True Positive Rate: 96.5\% for 1\% threshold
\item False Positive Rate: 4.2\% (mainly due to lighting changes)
\item Average processing time: 185 ms per frame
\item Memory usage: 3.2 MB peak (including 4MB PSRAM)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{System Reliability}

Long-term deployment tests over 30 days demonstrated:
\begin{itemize}
\item 99.7\% uptime with automatic recovery from network failures
\item Successful reconnection within 30 seconds of network restoration
\item No memory leaks or system crashes
\item Power consumption averaging 0.8W during operation
\end{itemize}
